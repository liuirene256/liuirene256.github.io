            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 4/5</p>
              <p>Overall: A lot of this class is just letting your brain
                marinate on the content you've injested, but it's very rewarding and you can definitely
                feel your brain grow as the class progresses. Content was super interesting and dealt with 
                many abstract topics. This was definitely the hardest class of my freshman year but the TAs
                and professors are super accommodating, helpful, and intelligent. 
              </p>
              <p>Exams: Very difficult for me. Some questions would have multiple versions 
                of different difficulties and point values; I would suggest thinking through the 
                lower point value ones first and sketch a solution before doing the full point questions
                unless you're very confident in your answer.
              </p>
              <p>Homeworks: Difficult but fun. You write up the solutions in a timed, proctored
                environment called a writing session, but the questions are posted ahead of time so 
                really you have a lot of time to think. You will surely become very close to the group you
                choose, and other people in the class, as you guys struggle together.

                <p>Difficulty: 2/5</p>
                <p>Overall: The content is pretty applicable for quant and built my recursive problem solving.
                    I wasn't super involved in this class, but still enjoyed the material taught.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: Easy! They released a bunch of practice problems and some would
                    be exactly the same as the actual short answer questions. Lots of true/false and 
                    fill in the blanks.  
                </p>
                <p>Homework: Were in SML and pretty light / short in terms of lines of code. 
                    I got docked more points for the written parts, but overall it was alright.

            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 3/5</p>
                <p>Overall: I loved the professor's (Dr. David Handron) teaching. Definitely needed 
                    a lot of help from the TAs to get used to the content and understand the purpose
                    behind the strategies we learned. 
                </p>
                <p>Exams: he first midterm absolutely rocked my boat and I couldn't figure out any of the four 
                    questions (I also didn't study enough, so it's definitely on me). 
                    But once I got the hang of it, the midterms became alright/reasonable. 
                </p>
                <p>Homework: Grading is a lot lighter than CS classes, but since answers are all numerical,
                    you have to have the right answer to get a good grade. For me, OH was fundamental for 
                    completing homeworks.

                <p>Difficulty: 3/5</p>
                <p>Overall: This was my second time taking 3D calc/MVC so I already knew the strategies taught.
                    However, the professor (Clive Newstead) was amazing at explaining the theory behind
                    these strategies and I understood the content a LOT better compared to my first time taking.
                </p>
                <p>Exams: Ran out of time on all the midterms and the final. There's multiple choice, but those were the hardest questions.
                </p>
                <p>Homework: Alright and completely reasonable. Some of the very difficult problems were
                    graded for completion after the fact.

                <p>Overall: Needed to take this class to declare AI major. Many people dropped. Workload and 
                    difficulty were both reasonable.

            <p>Other commitments: TAed 15-151, danced in a campus kpop group, and attended a hackathon</p>
            <p>Overall: Deadly during first half, medium after 07-180 (mini) was over</p>
            <p>Thoughts: This semester was very hard mentally for me, but brought a lot of personal growth and resilience. 
                The first half of the semester was exceptionally difficult due to important people in my life leaving,
                but it led me to grew closer to my friends (especially those in 15-251 with me). Was also looking into 
                housing for next year which brought along its own stressors. My schedule was unmanageable without skipping classes
                and I was constantly grinding to finish homework. Midsemester grades were atrocious, but after the AI mini finished
                it was a lot more manageable and I somehow healed my grades and soul.
            </p>
            <p>Advice: Take some time to reflect. I wish I really thought through my major declaration,
                future housing, and relationships. Would definitely have suffered less this semester (and 
                future semesters) if I had taken the time to figure out what I really want and look at the bigger picture.

            <li class="collapsible">15-151: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science ðŸ©·</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 1/5</p>
                <p>I LOVED THIS CLASS. WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Professor (John Mackey) is genuinely the best
                    lecturer and an incredibly interesting person. The content (discrete math at other universities
                    plus some extra fun stuff) was also transformative
                    and formalized everything I knew about CS, problem solving, and technical communication. 
                    Also served as an introduction to LaTeX which I love almost as much as I loved this class.
                    Met some of my favorite people in this class, and also bonded with others later on over our
                    love for 15-151. Ended up TAing the semester after.
                </p>
                <p>Midterms are curved and were very fun for me. If you understand the content, they're light,
                    but if not, they serve as a good reminder to spend more time with the material.
                </p>
                <p>Homeworks were so fun. I loved LaTeXing it all up and creating beauty from mathematics.
                    There were also optional bonus problems that had some interesting tricks to them. 
                </p>
              </div>
            <li class="collapsible">15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation ðŸŒŸ</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Difficulty: 2/5</p>
                <p> Basically your average data structures and algorithms class. The content carried
                    me through many OAs and technical interviews (who needs leetcode when you have 122)!
                </p>
                <p>Ran out of time, especially on the first midterm. But they are curved in the sense that 
                    questions many people get wrong are weighted less, so in the end my grades were a lot higher
                    than I expected. Questions were pretty reasonable and reflective of past homework assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Homeworks were pretty straightforward and in C. They do take some time / are quite long 
                    but are doable and reflective of the programming we do in labs. I spent more time helping 
                    non-CS friends with assignments than I spent doing them myself.
                </p>
              </div>
            <li class="collapsible">21-242: Matrix Theory</li>
            <div class="content">
                <p> Difficulty: 4/5</p>
                <p> Overall: Took a placement exam in the beginning of the year and qualified for honors linear algebra
                    (matrix theory). Class was small so I was able to get a lot of one-on-one help from the 
                    professor and the TAs. This was the first class I really struggled in so I didn't have the
                    best experience, but it prepared me very well for future classes in that I learned how to ask for
                    help and prepare for difficult exams. 
                </p>
                <p> Exams: Each test had one proof problem that I could never fully get. The computational problems were alright
                    though and carried my grade. Was this professors first time teaching, though, so this might change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Homeworks: All I can say is that I did 90% of the homework in OH. Questions were difficult, 
                    the proofs for them even harder. The grading is lenient though.

                <p> Overall: Was a night class which is definitely not for me, especially in winter.
                    It felt like this class made me miss out on a lot of fun get togethers with friends 
                    and the labs were questionable. Professor was extraordinarily kind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lab Notebooks: These took way too much time and was all busy work. However, I think all the lab requirements are like this.
                    They graded really leniently except for the second notebook which was ultimately curved but made me question everything.

            <p>Thoughts: Ah to be young and chilling through finals season again.
                It was very fun to meet people and I had the best time of my life.
                Many core memories were made and I think I will always look back lovingly on this time.
                A huge culture shift was that everyone was so interconnected despite there being so many people. 
            </p>
            <p>Advice: Join clubs, meet upperclassmen. It'll be a lot harder to join clubs and 
            meet people later on when workload increases. The few upperclassmen I did befriend
            were transformative to my college experience and gave tons of indispensable advice regarding 
            courses, professors, career, and people.
