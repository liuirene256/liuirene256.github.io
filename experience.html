            <h3>Software Engineering Intern, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.magnetar.com/">Magnetar</a> is a leading alternative asset management hedge fund. At this internship, I build an automated monitoring system to verify 
                the delivery of outsourced holdings and market data files. The program was first deployed on Docker and then run with a task scheduler 
                to regularly check that files were delivered at the expected time and if missing files were delivered later on. 
                I equipped the program with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to alert deliverers of missing files to cover all needs of the firm.
                The program decreased latency by reducing delivery delays and back-office overtime toil and gave me exposure to C#,
                Docker, Kubernetes, YAML, and SMTP. 
                Additionally, I had the opportunity to build a professional network with leaders of the firm and attended industry workshops and webinars.

            <h3>Firmware Engineering Intern, 2024</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.panduit.com/">Panduit</a> is a provider of networking and electrical solutions. Here, I developed the PDUs' communication protocol (SNMP) to accommodate multiple administrative users.
                Doing so involved coming up with clever implementations that support parallel database retrievals and modifications 
                to and from the management information base (MIB). By leveraging C's unique memory management, I was able to
                incorporate this new feature, making the PDUs more desirable and applicable for larger tech companies.
                Working at Panduit gave me extensive exposure with Linux, Git & Bitbucket, and C programming as well as 
                experience working on large codebases with other programmers.

            <h3>Researcher, 2021-Present</h3>
            <p>
                I led 2 major research projects as first author with 
                <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=12460">Dr. Claus-Peter Richter</a>. 
                For the first, we aimed to reduce diagnosis cost and increase diagnosis
                timeliness and accessability in primary care. To do so, I wrote signal processing
                and machine learning algorithms using MATLAB and Python to detect a nasal disease called 
                Chronic Rhinosinusitis based on speech with >73% accuracy. 
                For the second project, I wrote code to automatically parse and analyze 
                1000+ X-ray fluorescence microscopy scans. Then, collaborating with
                the lab, we ran statistical analysis to detect the effectiveness of biphosphonate
                treatment for Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Both projects were presented
                at prestigious conferences (ARO and ABRCMS) and are submitted for peer-review.

            <h3>Summer Intern, 2022</h3>
            <p>
                As a summer intern in UChicago's 
                <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html">Security, Algorithms, Networks and Data Lab</a>, 
                I worked on the PimEyes project under Prof. Ben Zhao and
                with Emily Wenger. I designed a deep learning face generation 
                program to create 20+ deepfakes to measure the scope of 
                <a href="https://pimeyes.com/en">PimEyes'</a> image
                scraping capabilities. For measuring purposes, I built honeypot 
                website and social media accounts to be scraped. Additionally,
                I presented findings with the lab and assisted other adhoc lab research.
